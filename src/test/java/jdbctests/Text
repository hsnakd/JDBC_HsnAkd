    We use next() method to iterate each rows
    While the next row is not NULL we can continue to iterate
    If next row is NULL (empty),it exits the loop immediately
    You can use getString(columnName) to get cell value

* next()        ==> move to next row and return true/false according to if we have valid row
* previous()    ==> move to previous row and return true/false according to if we have valid row
* first()       ==> move to first row from anywhere
* last()        ==> move to last row from anywhere
* beforeFirst() ==> move to before first location from anywhere
* afterLast()   ==> move to after last location from anywhere
* absolute(8)   ==> move to any row by using row number, for example 8 in this case

* getString(ColumnName)     ==>
* getString(ColumnIndex)    ==>
* getInt(ColumnName)        ==>
* getInt(ColumnIndex)       ==>
* getDouble(ColumnName)     ==>
* getDouble(ColumnIndex)    ==>
* getDate(ColumnName)       ==>
* getDate(ColumnIndex)      ==>
